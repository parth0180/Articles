Creating a README file for your project is a great idea to document its setup, functionality, and troubleshooting steps. Below is an example README file that includes instructions on installation, logic explanation, and troubleshooting tips for handling lock wait timeouts in your PHP application with MySQL.

# Articles Demo Application README

This repository contains a simple blog application built using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete articles.

### Features

- **Create Articles:** Users can create new articles with a title, description, category, and slug.
- **Read Articles:** Display all articles with details including creation time and last update time.
- **Update Articles:** Edit existing articles.
- **Delete Articles:** Remove articles from the database.

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Bootstrap for styling)
- **Backend:** PHP
- **Database:** MySQL

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the blog application locally on your machine.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd blog-application
   ```

2. **Database Setup:**

   - **MySQL Configuration:**
     - Ensure MySQL server is installed and running.
     - Modify MySQL configuration (`my.cnf` or `my.ini`) to increase `innodb_lock_wait_timeout` to handle potential lock wait timeouts. Example configuration:
       ```ini
       [mysqld]
       innodb_lock_wait_timeout = 120
       ```

3. **Import Database:**
   - Import the provided SQL file (`blog_db.sql`) into your MySQL database to create the necessary tables.
     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p blog_db < blog_db.sql
     ```

4. **Configure Database Connection:**
   - Update `config.php` with your MySQL database credentials.
     ```php
     <?php
     $servername = "localhost";
     $username = "root";
     $password = "";
     $dbname = "blog_db";

     // Create connection
     $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

     if ($conn->connect_error) {
         die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
     }
     ?>
     ```

5. **Run the Application:**
   - Start your local web server (e.g., Apache) and navigate to the blog application directory in your web browser.
   - Example URL: `http://localhost/blog-application/articles.php`

### Logic for Handling Lock Wait Timeouts

The application includes retry logic in `delete_article.php` to handle lock wait timeouts gracefully. If a `DELETE` operation encounters a lock wait timeout, the script retries the operation up to a specified number of times (`$maxRetries`). This helps mitigate transient database locking issues.

```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$dbname = "blog_db";

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

function deleteArticle($conn, $id) {
    $sql = "DELETE FROM articles WHERE id=$id";
    return $conn->query($sql);
}

if (isset($_GET['id'])) {
    $id = $_GET['id'];
    $retryCount = 0;
    $maxRetries = 3; // Adjust the number of retries as needed
    $success = false;

    while ($retryCount < $maxRetries && !$success) {
        if (deleteArticle($conn, $id)) {
            $success = true;
        } else {
            $error = $conn->error;
            if (strpos($error, 'Lock wait timeout exceeded') !== false) {
                $retryCount++;
                sleep(1); // Wait for 1 second before retrying
            } else {
                echo "Error: " . $error;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    if ($success) {
        // Redirect to articles.php after deletion
        header("Location: articles.php");
        exit();
    } else {
        echo "Failed to delete the article after $maxRetries retries.";
    }

    $conn->close();
} else {
    echo "Invalid request.";
}
?>
```

### Troubleshooting

- **MySQL Lock Wait Timeout Exceeded:**
  - If you encounter `Lock wait timeout exceeded` errors, try increasing `innodb_lock_wait_timeout` in MySQL configuration.
  - Implement retry logic in database operations (`delete_article.php`) to handle transient locking issues.

- **Database Connection Issues:**
  - Ensure `config.php` has correct MySQL database credentials.
  - Verify MySQL server is running and accessible from PHP scripts.

Adjust the paths, database credentials, and retry logic (`$maxRetries`) as per your specific application needs. This README provides a structured guide for setting up, understanding the application's logic, and troubleshooting common issues.
